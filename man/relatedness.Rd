Documentation for SLiM function \code{relatedness}, which is a method of the
SLiM class \code{Individual}.
}
\details{
Returns a vector containing the degrees of relatedness between the
receiver and each of the individuals in individuals. The relatedness between A
and B is always 1.0 if A and B are actually the same individual; this facility
works even if SLiMâ€™s optional pedigree tracking is turned off (in which case
all other relatedness values will be 0.0). Otherwise, if pedigree tracking is
turned on with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T), this method will use
the pedigree information described in section 23.6.1 to construct a relatedness
estimate. More specifically, if information about the grandparental generation
is available, then each grandparent shared by A and B contributes 0.125 towards
the total relatedness, for a maximum value of 0.5 with four shared grandparents.
If grandparental information in unavailable, then if parental information is
available it is used, with each parent shared by A and B contributing 0.25,
again for a maximum of 0.5. If even parental information is unavailable, then
the relatedness is assumed to be 0.0. Again, however, if A and B are the same
individual, the relatedness will be 1.0 in all cases. Note that this relatedness
is simply pedigree-based relatedness. This does not necessarily correspond
to genetic relatedness, because of the effects of factors like assortment and
recombination.
