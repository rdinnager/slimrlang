Documentation for SLiM function \code{totalOfNeighborStrengths}, which is a
method of the SLiM class \code{InteractionType}.
}
\details{
Returns a vector of the total interaction strength felt by each
individual in individuals, which does not need to be a singleton; indeed, it
can be a vector of all of the individuals in a given subpopulation. However,
all of the individuals in individuals must be in the same subpopulation. For
one individual, this is essentially the same as calling nearestNeighbors() with
a large count so as to obtain the complete vector of all neighbors, calling
strength() for each of those interactions to get each interaction strength,
and adding those interaction strengths together with sum(). This method is
much faster than that implementation, however, since all of that work is
done as a single operation. Also, totalOfNeighborStrengths() can total up
interactions for more than one focal individual in a single call. Similarly,
for one individual this is essentially the same as calling strength() to get the
interaction strengths between the focal individual and all other individuals,
and then calling sum(). Again, this method should be much faster, since this
algorithm looks only at neighbors, whereas calling strength() directly assesses
interaction strengths with all other individuals. This will make a particularly
large difference when the subpopulation size is large and the maximum distance
of the InteractionType is small. If the needed interaction strengths have
already been calculated, those cached values are simply used. Otherwise, calling
this method triggers evaluation of the needed interactions, including calls to
any applicable interaction() callbacks.
