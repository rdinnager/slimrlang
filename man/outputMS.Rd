\title{SLiM method outputMS}
\usage{
outputMS(filePath, append, filterMonomorphic)
}
\arguments{
\item{filePath}{An object of type null or string. Must be of length 1 (a
singleton). The default value is \code{NULL}. See details for description.}

\item{append}{An object of type logical. Must be of length 1 (a singleton). The
default value is \code{F}. See details for description.}

\item{filterMonomorphic}{An object of type logical. Must be of length 1 (a
singleton). The default value is \code{F}. See details for description.}
}
\value{
An object of type void.
}
\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{outputMS}, which is a method of the SLiM
class \code{Genome}.
}
\details{
Output the target genomes in MS format (see section 25.3.2 for output
format details). This low-level output method may be used to output any sample
of Genome objects (the Eidos function sample() may be useful for constructing
custom samples, as may the SLiM class Individual). For output of a sample
from a single Subpopulation, the outputMSSample() of Subpopulation may be
more straightforward to use. If the optional parameter filePath is NULL (the
default), output is directed to SLiMâ€™s standard output. Otherwise, the output
is sent to the file specified by filePath, overwriting that file if append if F,
or appending to the end of it if append is T. Positions in the output will span
the interval \link{0,1}. If filterMonomorphic is F (the default), all mutations that
are present in the sample will be included in the output. This means that some
mutations may be included that are actually monomorphic within the sample (i.e.,
that exist in every sampled genome, and are thus apparently fixed). These may be
filtered out with filterMonomorphic = T if desired; note that this option means
that some mutations that do exist in the sampled genomes might not be included
in the output, simply because they exist in every sampled genome. See output()
and outputVCF() for other output formats. Output is generally done in a late()
event, so that the output reflects the state of the simulation at the end of a
generation.
