Documentation for SLiM function \code{setSpatialPosition}, which is a method of
the SLiM class \code{Individual}.
}
\details{
Sets the spatial position of the individual (as accessed through
the spatialPosition property). The length of position (the number of
coordinates in the spatial position of an individual) depends upon the
spatial dimensionality declared with initializeSLiMOptions(). If the spatial
dimensionality is zero (as it is by default), it is an error to call this
method. The elements of position are set into the values of the x, y, and z
properties (if those properties are encompassed by the spatial dimensionality
of the simulation). In other words, if the declared dimensionality is "xy",
calling individual.setSpatialPosition(c(1.0, 0.5)) property is equivalent to
individual.x = 1.0; individual.y = 0.5; individual.z is not set (even if a third
value is supplied in position) since it is not encompassed by the simulationâ€™s
dimensionality in this example. Note that this is an Eidos class method,
somewhat unusually, which allows it to work in a special way when called on a
vector of individuals. When the target vector of individuals is non-singleton,
this method can do one of two things. If position contains just a single point
(i.e., is equal in length to the spatial dimensionality of the model), the
spatial position of all of the target individuals will be set to the given
point. Alternatively, if position contains one point per target individual
(i.e., is equal in length to the number of individuals multiplied by the spatial
dimensionality of the model), the spatial position of each target individual
will be set to the corresponding point from position (where the point data is
concatenated, not interleaved, just as it would be returned by accessing the
spatialPosition property on the vector of target individuals). Calling this
method with a position vector of any other length is an error.
