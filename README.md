# slimrlang

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of slimrlang is to provide an environment in which you can
write SLiM population genetics simulation scripts from R. It works
particularly well with RStudio, but any R IDE can be used. For much more
advanced functionality in running and processing SLiM simulations from
R, see the [`slimr`](https://github.com/rdinnager/slimr) package which
imports `slimrlang`.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rdinnager/slimrlang")
```

## Example

Coming soonâ€¦
